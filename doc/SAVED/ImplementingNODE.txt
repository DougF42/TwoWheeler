Notes - changes I made in SMAC:

// ORGANIZATION:
STARTED with Example1. 
* moved all .cpp into src/SMAC
* moved all .h   into include/SMAC
* Added build_flags option in platform.ini to include new include directory:
    build_flags = -I include/SMAC

* NOTE: To build on this platform, need to:
  (1) Add an include for "esp_mac.h" to node.h

  (2) In node.h and node.cpp:
       Modify onCommandReceived definition (in Node):
       first argument should be "const esp_now_recv_info_t * esp_now_info"
       NOT "const uint8_t".  This does not affect the existing program logic.

  (3) Change all instances of 'neopixelWrite() to rgbLedWrite(). This Appears to be a name 
       change only - Arguments are identical.

* ADDED nodex class - inherits node, extends it...
* * Moved RelayerMAC definition into Node.h.
* * Added the Relayer Mac Address to the Nodex initializer. 
* * Added 'get' and 'set' methods for the Relayer Mac Address.

* * Added Moved 'ping' logic into Nodex.
