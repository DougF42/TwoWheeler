This attempts to regularize the various units of measure...

Units of measure as used internally.  
(Note: Some commands accept other units - these are immediatly converted to internal units.)

(1) H298: PWM settings are 0 to +/-100 (pulse width percent on).  
    pulse rate is a frequency (default 4khz).

(2) Quad decoder: circumfrence is in mm. 
    speed check interval in milliseconds.

(3) MOTORControl: (combines H298, Quad, PID)
    PID loop time and speed check:  milliseconds between loops.
    Speed is in mm/second.

(4) Driver (combines 2 MOTORControl instances)
    Speed is in mm/millisecond.
    Rate of turn is Radians/millisecond

SETTINGS:
   [NOTE: ALL COMMANDS ARE PROCESSED IN THE DRIVER, and passed down as needed]
(1) H298:     pulse rate frequency (FIXED-not settable)
(2) QUAD:     points ('holes') per rev, circum
(3) PID:      Kp, Ki, Pd                 PID

(4) DRIVER:   desired Speed              FWD
